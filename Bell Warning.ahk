 Cleanup Music Script for Class Transitions
===============================================
This AutoHotkey script plays a cleanup song **1 minute before class ends** 
to help students prepare for transition. 

🔹 **How It Works:**
   - Checks the system clock every second.
   - Plays a cleanup song based on the class schedule.
   - Automatically **pauses Spotify** if music is playing.
   - **Resumes Spotify** after the cleanup song finishes.
   - Supports **regular and delayed start schedules**.

🔹 **How to Customize:**
   - 🎵 **Change the cleanup song**: Modify `CleanupSongPath`.
   - 🕒 **Modify schedule times**: Edit `MondayToThursdayTimes`, `FridayTimes`, `DelayedTimes`.
   - 🔄 **Use Delayed Start Schedule**: Set `UseDelayedSchedule := True` (or `False` for normal schedule).
   - 🔊 **Adjust volume fade-in**: Modify `FadeStep` and `FadeDelay`.
